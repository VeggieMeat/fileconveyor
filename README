This is a fork of the excellent fileconveyor by wimleers which allows the
synced_files table to be stored with either sqlite3 or MySQLdb as the
backend. This can be configured in settings.py. The default settings make this
behave just like the original.

I was working on optimizing a high-traffic website by balancing web traffic
across several homogeneous web servers and needed a central place
to store user generated content instead of trying to copy it around to a bunch
of web servers. Fileconveyor works great for sending uploaded files to an FTP
server but then it would only be aware of the file it synced and not those
synced from other web servers.

Perhaps in the future the interactions with the synced_files table could be
moved into an abstract class? Then new backends could easily be added by sub-
classing and the backend could even be configured via config.xml!

The Drupal CDN module was also forked and modified to query MySQL for
synced_files but I didn't do that so I don't have the changes...
