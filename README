This is a fork of the excellent fileconveyor by wimleers which replaces the
Sqlite backend for the synced_files table with a MySQL backend.

I was working on optimizing a high-traffic website and needed a central place
to store user generated content instead of trying to copy it around to a bunch
of webservers. Fileconveyor works great for sending uploaded file to an FTP
server but then it would only be aware of it's own synced files and not those
synced from other webservers.

I look forward to abstracting the synced_tables functionality to allow for
switching between the two backends using only the config file.

Changes were also made to the Drupal CDN module so that it would query the
synced_files table in MySQL rather than Sqlite.
